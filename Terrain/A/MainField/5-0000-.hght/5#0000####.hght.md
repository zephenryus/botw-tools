## General Information

hght files describe the terrain's height map.

- Compression: None
- Yaz0-Encoded: ``No``

## Layout

hght files are an array of unsigned short integers ranging from ``0x0000`` to ``0xffff``, with ``0x0000`` being the lowest height and ``0xffff`` being the highest. Heights are applied to verticies starting at the North-West corner of a tile and run 256 vertices before starting on the next row.
